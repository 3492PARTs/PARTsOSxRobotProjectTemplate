# PARTsRobotProjectTemplate
This is a template for FIRST Robotics Team 3492 to follow when starting and coding a robot project. In this template you will find:
*Icons
*A blank robot project
*Git ignore file

##Icons
In this folder you will find various sized PARTs icons. They should be used when making VIs. To use the icons, you should put the folder in C:\Users\USER\Documents\LabVIEW Data. After that the icons will be visible to LabVIEW.

##Robot Project
This is just an outline to follow when making a project, you should never put any code in this, as from year to year projects are typically not that compatible with the newer LabVIEW version. That being said, this will have the basic structure so you can look through it and see how you should set up your project.

##Git Ignore File
This is not actually any code ore anything needed for a robot project. What it is, is an ignore file all it does is tell git hub some files specific to LabVIEW development not to push ever. These are generic files that nobody needs, so it just removes clutter from the repository.
